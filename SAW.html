  <p2> Strengths </p2>
  <p>
    The strenght I have is being super motivated when I am intrested to something,
    I will work hard until I get a result that I can do best. Next, when it comes to communication,
    I always as friendly as I can during the conversation with my classmates or whoever else. Talking to
    people with a positive or encourageous tone will sometimes increase their motivation to do the work.

  <p2> Weaknesses </p2>
  <p>
    The critical weaknesses I have lacking the concept of time.Sometimes I will not know what the time is,
    that means I didnt actually know how many time I spend in doing 1 work. And also,sometimes I did not know
    that the work due is a closing and I will doing other work. Beside of lacking the concept
    of time, I also lacking the leadership skill. Although that is the case, my classmate often choose me
    as the group leader and they almost complain nothing about it. So I guess that is just a training for me
    as a group leader or they just lazy the be the group leader.
